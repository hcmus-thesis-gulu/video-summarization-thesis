\begin{ChapAbstract}
  Deep learning methods have dominated the video summarization task for a long time due to their remarkable ability to automatically learn relevant features and representations from large-scale video data. In this chapter, we initially cover the fundamental aspects, encompassing the problem statement, datasets used, and evaluation metrics employed in video summarization research in Section \ref{section:rel-preliminary}. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough examination of the existing literature in video summarization, emphasizing three principal categories of approaches: supervised methods (Section \ref{section:rel-supervised}), unsupervised methods (Section \ref{section:rel-weakly}), and weakly supervised methods (Section \ref{section:rel-unsupervised}).

% CNNs-based methods have dominated the medical image segmentation task for a long time due to its simplicity and effectiveness. 
% Moreover, Transformers-based methods recently have the attention as a replacement of CNNs-based ones in large-scale datasets; meanwhile, Hybrid methods, which are the combinations of both approaches, are simultaneously under research.
% In this chapter, we go through these above categories in that order with the outstanding methods in each one. 
% Besides, we discuss the limitations of each approach at the end of each section, which leads to the motivation of our proposed method in the next chapter.
