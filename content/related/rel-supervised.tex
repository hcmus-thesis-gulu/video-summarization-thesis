\section{Supervised approaches} 
Supervised methods rely on datasets with human-labeled ground-truth annotations. For example, the SumMe dataset \cite{SumMe} utilizes video summaries as ground truth, while the TVSum dataset \cite{TVSum} employs frame-level importance scores. By leveraging this labeled data, supervised approaches aim to learn the criteria for selecting video frames or fragments to construct effective video summaries.
