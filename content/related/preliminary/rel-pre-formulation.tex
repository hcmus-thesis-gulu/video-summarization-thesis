\subsection{Problem Formulation}
\label{subsec:rel-formulation}
Given an input video $\textbf{I}=\{I^{(t)}\}_{t=1}^T$ where each frame $I^{(t)} \in \mathbb{R} ^{C \times H \times W}$, the goal of video summarization using the storyboard approach is to generate a concise summary $\textbf{G}$ that consists of a subset of representative frames. The generated summary $\textbf{G}$ is denoted as $\{I^{(t_i)}\}^k_{i=1}$, where $k$ is typically much smaller than $T$ and $t_1 < t_2 < \dots < t_k$.
