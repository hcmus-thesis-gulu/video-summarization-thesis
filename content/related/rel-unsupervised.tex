\section{Unsupervised approaches} 
\label{section:rel-unsupervised} 

Unsupervised methods eliminate the need for ground-truth data, which typically requires time-consuming and labor-intensive manual annotation. Instead, unsupervised approaches leverage large collections of original videos for training. Through learning mechanisms designed for unsupervised settings, these methods extract meaningful information from the video data to generate summaries.
