An entropy sampling technique is used to select informative points thus reducing computational complexity while performing superior to uniform sampling. The sampled points are used to design a novel learning framework for convolutional filters based on boosting. Filters are learned in several layers with the output of previous layers serving as the input to the next layer. A softmax logistic classifier is subsequently trained on the output of all learned filters and applied on test images. The output of the classifier is subject to an unsupervised graph cut algorithm followed by a convex hull transformation to obtain the final segmentation. Our proposed algorithm for optic cup and disc segmentation outperforms existing methods on the public DRISHTI-GS data set on several metrics."

abstract = "Background and objective
Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading disabling chronic diseases and one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in developed world. Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy enables timely treatment and in order to achieve it a major effort will have to be invested into automated population screening programs. Detection of exudates in color fundus photographs is very important for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.
Methods
We use deep convolutional neural networks for exudate detection. In order to incorporate high level anatomical knowledge about potential exudate locations, output of the convolutional neural network is combined with the output of the optic disc detection and vessel detection procedures.
Results
In the validation step using a manually segmented image database we obtain a maximum F1 measure of 0.78.
Conclusions
As manually segmenting and counting exudate areas is a tedious task, having a reliable automated output, such as automated segmentation using convolutional neural networks in combination with other landmark detectors, is an important step in creating automated screening programs for early detection of diabetic retinopathy."

Four modules were included in the diagnosis system: data weighing, feature selection, dividing co-training data labeling, and CNN. 3158 region of interests (ROIs) with each containing a mass extracted from 1874 pairs of mammogram images were used for this study. Among them 100 ROIs were treated as labeled data while the rest were treated as unlabeled. The area under the curve (AUC) observed in our study was 0.8818, and the accuracy of CNN is 0.8243 using the mixed labeled and unlabeled data."

abstract = "Lung nodules are small, round, or oval-shaped masses of tissue in the lung region. Early diagnosis and treatment of lung nodules can significantly improve the quality of patients’ lives. Because of their small size and the interlaced nature of chest anatomy, detection of lung nodules using different medical imaging techniques becomes challenging. Recently, several methods for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) were proposed to improve the detection of lung nodules with good performances. However, the current methods are unable to achieve high sensitivity and high specificity. In this paper, we propose using deep feature fusion from the non-medical training and hand-crafted features to reduce the false positive results. Based on our experimentation of the public dataset, our results show that, the deep fusion feature can achieve promising results in terms of sensitivity and specificity (69.3% and 96.2%) at 1.19 false positive per image, which is better than the single hand-crafted features (62% and 95.4%) at 1.45 false positive per image. As it stands, fusion features that were used to classify our candidate nodules have resulted in a more promising outcome as compared to the single features from deep learning features and the hand-crafted features. This will improve the current CAD method based on the use of deep feature fusion to more effectively diagnose the presence of lung nodules."

Problematically, the visual indicators of ROP are not well understood and neonatal fundus images are usually of poor quality and resolution. We investigate two ways to aid clinicians in ROP detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN): (1) We fine-tune a pretrained GoogLeNet as a ROP detector and with small modifications also return an approximate Bayesian posterior over disease presence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first completely automated ROP detection system. (2) To further aid grading, we train a second CNN to return novel feature map visualizations of pathologies, learned directly from the data. These feature maps highlight discriminative information, which we believe may be used by clinicians with our classifier to aid in screening.",

abstract="For neuroimaging-based brain disease diagnosis, sparse regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data but with a small number of samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that utilizes sparse regression models as target-level representation learner and builds a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which has different values of a regularization control parameter, and use the outputs of the trained regression models as target-level representations. Note that sparse regression models trained with different values of a regularization control parameter potentially select different sets of features from the original ones, thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., a clinical label and clinical scores in our work. We then construct a deep convolutional neural network by taking the target-level representations as input. Our deep network learns to optimally fuse the predicted response variables, i.e., target-level representations, from the same sparse response model(s) and also those from the neighboring sparse response models. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that systematically integrates sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest classification accuracies in three different tasks of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment identification.",

abstract = "This paper describes a general methodology for developing parallel image processing algorithms based on message passing for high resolution images (on the order of several Gigabytes). These algorithms have been applied to histological images and must be executed on massively parallel processing architectures. Advances in new technologies for complete slide digitalization in pathology have been combined with developments in biomedical informatics. However, the efficient use of these digital slide systems is still a challenge. The image processing that these slides are subject to is still limited both in terms of data processed and processing methods. The work presented here focuses on the need to design and develop parallel image processing tools capable of obtaining and analyzing the entire gamut of information included in digital slides. Tools have been developed to assist pathologists in image analysis and diagnosis, and they cover low and high-level image processing methods applied to histological images. Code portability, reusability and scalability have been tested by using the following parallel computing architectures: distributed memory with massive parallel processors and two networks, INFINIBAND and Myrinet, composed of 17 and 1024 nodes respectively. The parallel framework proposed is flexible, high performance solution and it shows that the efficient processing of digital microscopic images is possible and may offer important benefits to pathology laboratories."

abstract = "After binarization of cells in complex cytological and histological images the segmented structures can be rather far away from a final quantification of features of single cells since cells may overlap and cluster strongly. Separating optically, partially or totally fused entities like cells is a problem which frequently cannot be solved by a watershed segmentation or a basic morphological processing of images. However, considering different morphological scales after iterative erosion gives rise to dominant markers of singular objects. Performing a reconstruction by iterative dilation yields a scale-independent decomposition of multiple disjointed cell clumps of different sizes within an image. Accordingly we developed a technique that splits cell clumps into meaningful parts. Since this method is based on the analysis of the morphological-scale space, generated by iterative erosion, it is independent on the size of cell clusters. The detection of dominant points within the eroded scales are cell-specific markers. The converse integration of markers at different scales is obtained by a successive reconstruction based on constrained dilation of the original cell shape. The advantages of this approach are the independence of cell shapes which are clumped, the consideration of holes or background intensities within objects and the robustness with regard to convergence. An important benefit is the fitting of the operation time to the size of clusters by the size of the morphological structuring element. This means, that this approach requires only one parameter. Finally, a better match of the morphological scale space approach was found and compared with the ground truth as well as the results of the watershed technique. The primary object of this paper is to highlight the algorithm and its results by using different examples from benchmark databases, self generated images that exhibit different topological features and complex configurations of cells within histological images."

abstract="Automated skin lesion classification in the dermoscopy images is an essential way to improve diagnostic performance and reduce melanoma deaths. Although deep learning has shown proven advantages over traditional methods, which rely on handcrafted features, in image classification, it remains challenging to classify skin lesions due to the significant intra-class variation and inter-class similarity. In this paper, we propose a synergic deep learning (SDL) model to address this issue, which not only uses dual deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) but also enables them to mutually learn from each other. Specifically, we concatenate the image representation learned by both DCNNs as the input of a synergic network, which has a fully connected structure and predicts whether the pair of input images belong to the same class. We train the SDL model in the end-to-end manner under the supervision of the classification error in each DCNN and the synergic error. We evaluated our SDL model on the ISIC 2016 Skin Lesion Classification dataset and achieved the state-of-the-art performance.",

abstract="This paper addresses the problem of generating possible object locations for use in object recognition. We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99 {\%} recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/{\textasciitilde}uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html).",

abstract="Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used approach for diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed to adopt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify ultrasound images and predict tumor malignancy. CNN is a successful algorithm for image recognition tasks and has achieved human-level performance in real applications. To improve the performance of CNN in breast cancer diagnosis, we integrated domain knowledge and conducted multi-task learning in the training process. After training, a radiologist visually inspected the class activation map of the last convolutional layer of trained network to evaluate the result. Our result showed that CNN classifier can not only give reasonable performance in predicting breast cancer, but also propose potential lesion regions which can be integrated into the breast ultrasound system in the future.",

abstract = "Predictions of the secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme, made by a number of investigators on the basis of the amino acid sequence, are compared with the structure of the protein determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography. Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both β-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140–142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations."
