\begin{ChapAbstract}
In this chapter, we first introduce existing interactive retrieval systems, their retrieval mechanism and how users interact with data in those systems.
We also mention the previous versions of our system as a comparison.
Next, we discuss several state-of-the-art approaches related to the referring expression segmentation problem. 
We also discuss the query-based architectures that recently achieved massive success in several tasks. 
In the last section, we provided the discussion about the Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation task that is applied in our segmentation module.
