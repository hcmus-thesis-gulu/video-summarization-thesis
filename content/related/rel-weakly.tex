\section{Weakly Supervised approaches}
\label{section:rel-weakly}

Weakly-supervised approaches: Similar to unsupervised approaches, weakly-supervised methods aim to reduce the reliance on extensive sets of hand-labeled data. Instead, they utilize less expensive weak labels that are known to be imperfect compared to full human annotations. However, even with these imperfect labels, weakly-supervised approaches can still create robust predictive models for video summarization.

% These categories represent distinct approaches for tackling the challenges associated with training deep learning models for video summarization, and each approach offers its own advantages and considerations. The subsequent sections of this chapter will delve into the specific details of each approach, highlighting key papers and their contributions in advancing the field of video summarization. This comprehensive examination will provide a deeper understanding of the methodologies employed and shed light on the progress made in video summarization research.
