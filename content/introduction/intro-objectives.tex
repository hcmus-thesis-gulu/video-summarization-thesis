\section{Objectives}
\label{section:intro-objectives}

In this thesis, our objective is to address the longstanding problem in the field of Computer Vision by proposing human-centric solutions for video summarization. Our main contributions are as follows:



\begin{itemize}
  \item Self-supervised Model: We introduce a novel self-supervised model specifically designed for the video summarization task. By leveraging the intrinsic structure within videos, our model reduces the reliance on labor-intensive annotated data, making the summarization process more efficient and less dependent on human annotations.
  \item Human-centric Evaluation Pipeline: Recognizing the importance of real-life usability, we propose an evaluation pipeline that is tailored to human-centric criteria. This pipeline goes beyond traditional evaluation metrics and incorporates aspects that are more relevant and meaningful to human viewers, ensuring that the generated summaries align with human preferences and expectations.
\end{itemize}

Through these contributions, we aim to advance the field of video summarization by providing effective self-supervised methods and evaluation frameworks that prioritize human-centered perspectives and practical applications.
