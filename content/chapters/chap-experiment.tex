% \begin{ChapAbstract}
% This chapter shows detailed experiments on each proposed module in both qualitative and quantitative ways to evaluate their effect on the final retrieval results. 
% First, we introduce more details about the Lifelog Search Challenge 2022 and Visual Browser Showdown 2022, the evaluation metrics used in these challenges and the result of our interactive retrieval system on each challenge.
% Second, we evaluate the performance of our referring expression segmentation framework on both image and video datasets. 
% Finally, we analyse the qualitative results of our referring expression module on these datasets.

% Second, we provide the comprehensive settings of each module to perform its task.
% We then evaluate the performance of the retrieval module with the proposed encoding techniques and the accuracy of the refinement method on different aspects.
% Finally, we pick the best version from each module to produce the final result and compare it with other researches.
